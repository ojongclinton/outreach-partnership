Frontend Design Prompt
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, or applications. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics. license: Professional design updates

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.
The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.
Design Thinking
Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
Purpose: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
Tone: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
Constraints: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
Differentiation: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?
CRITICAL: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.
Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
Production-grade and functional
Visually striking and memorable
Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
Meticulously refined in every detail
Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines
Focus on:
Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
Spatial Composition: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
Backgrounds & Visual Details: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.
NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.
Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.
IMPORTANT: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Marketing/Sales Friendly Prompt
description: Build direct-response, conversion-focused sales pages that sell. Use this when creating landing pages, sales pages, or any page meant to convert visitors into leads/customers. Prioritizes clarity, benefits, and action over corporate polish.

This prompt guides creation of sales pages that actually convert — inspired by proven direct-response marketing (like selllikecrazy.co), not corporate websites.

Core Principles:
1. SIMPLE over fancy. MVP feel, not corporate polish. Avoid complex animations and effects that distract from the message.
2. BENEFITS over features. Everything should answer "What's in it for the customer?" Remove anything that talks about "us" or "our expertise" — focus on THEIR results.
3. LONG-FORM works. People scroll when content is compelling. Don't fear length — fear boring content.
4. REPEATED CTAs. Place a call-to-action button after every 2-3 sections. No matter where someone stops scrolling, there should be a CTA nearby.
5. STICKY CTA at bottom. Always visible, always accessible.

Page Structure (in order):
1. Hero: Big, bold, centered headline focused on the outcome they want. Subheadline that explains how. Single primary CTA button. Urgency/scarcity badge if applicable.

2. Pain Points ("Sound Familiar?"): List 6-8 specific frustrations your target customer faces. Use their language. Make them nod and think "that's me." End with a reframe + CTA.

3. What You Get: 4-6 benefit cards. Short titles, simple descriptions. Focus on outcomes (More Sales, Save Time, etc.), not deliverables.

4. How It Works: 3-4 simple steps. Make the process feel easy and low-risk. End with CTA.

5. Testimonials/Social Proof: Real quotes with names, roles, and specific results. Numbers are powerful ("300% more bookings", "60% revenue increase"). Add 5-star ratings.

6. Who This Is For / Not For: Two-column comparison. Left = ideal customer traits. Right = who should NOT work with you. This qualifies leads and makes good fits feel special. End with CTA.

7. Comparison Table: Compare "Do It Yourself" vs "Hire Freelancers" vs "Work With Us". Make the choice obvious. Use checkmarks and X icons.

8. What Happens Next (demystify the CTA): If your CTA is "Book a Call", explain exactly what happens on that call. Remove fear and uncertainty. 4 simple steps.

9. Pricing: Keep it simple. 3 options max. Highlight the recommended one. Include feature lists with checkmarks. CTA on each card.

10. FAQ: 6-10 common questions/objections. Answer them directly and honestly. End section with CTA.

11. Final CTA Section: Urgency badge, big headline, compelling subtext, prominent button, reassurance text ("No obligation", "Free", etc.)

Writing Style:
- Conversational, not corporate. Write like you talk.
- Short sentences. Short paragraphs.
- Use "you" and "your" constantly. Minimize "we" and "our".
- Specific > vague. "300% more bookings" beats "increased bookings".
- Address objections before they arise.
- Create urgency without being sleazy (limited spots, limited time, etc.)

Design Guidelines:
- Big, bold headlines. Readable from across the room.
- High contrast. Dark backgrounds with bright accent colors work well.
- Generous whitespace between sections.
- Cards and boxes to organize information.
- Icons to support text (not replace it).
- No fancy hover effects or complex animations — keep it focused on the message.
- Mobile-first. Most traffic is mobile.

What to AVOID:
- Corporate jargon ("synergy", "leverage", "solutions")
- Talking about yourself/your team/your process excessively
- Fancy animations that distract from the message
- Multiple CTAs with different actions (pick ONE action you want them to take)
- Walls of text without visual breaks
- Stock photos of handshakes and office buildings
- Pricing hidden or "contact for quote" (show real numbers when possible)
- Weak CTAs ("Learn More", "Submit") — use action-oriented text ("Book Your Free Call", "Get Started Now")

Remember: The goal is CONVERSION, not awards. A simple page that converts beats a beautiful page that doesn't.
